## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Flexbox

### What I learned

It was my first time using different images for different media sizes

```html
<picture>
  <source srcset="./images/desktop/image-transform.jpg" media="(min-width: 768px)" />
  <img src="./images/mobile/image-transform.jpg" alt="" />
</picture>
```
### Continued development

Propably a lot of space for improvement, especially in minimizing the amount of css.
